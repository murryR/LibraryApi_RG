## Searching for Books

### Using the Combined Search Filter

The system provides a single **Search books** field that lets you find books by name, author, or ISBN.

**How it works:**
- Type one or more search terms in the field
- The search is **case-insensitive** and matches **partial text** (e.g. "harry" matches "Harry Potter and the Philosopher's Stone")
- Results update automatically after you stop typing (500ms delay)
- Use **comma-separated terms** to narrow down results: each term must match name, author, or ISBN, and all terms must match (AND logic)

**Examples:**
- Typing `harry` will find books with "harry" in the title, author, or ISBN
- Typing `rowling, harry potter` will find books that match both "rowling" and "harry potter" (e.g. in author and title)
- Typing `978` will find books whose ISBN contains "978"

### Clearing Filters

To clear the filter and see all books:
- Delete the text in the search field
- The book list will automatically refresh to show all books

## Viewing Books

The books table displays the following information for each book:

| Column | Description |

| **Name** | The title of the book |
| **Author** | The author's name |

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

#### "No books found matching your filters"
- **Solution**: Clear your filters or adjust your search terms
- The book you're looking for might not be in the catalog

#### "No available copies of this book"
- **Solution**: All copies are currently borrowed
- Wait until someone returns a copy, or try a different book

#### "You don't have an active loan for this book"
- **Solution**: You can only return books you've borrowed
- Check "My Borrowed Books" to see what you currently have

#### "A book with this combination already exists"
- **Solution**: The book (same Name + Author + ISBN) is already in the catalog
- Search for it in the book list instead of adding it again

#### ISBN validation fails
- **Solution**: Ensure you're entering a valid ISBN-13 (13 digits)
- Check that the check digit is correct
- The field will show a red X if invalid

#### Cannot log in
- **Solution**: Check your username and password
- Contact your administrator if you've forgotten your credentials
- Ensure you're using the correct login credentials

#### Page not loading or errors
- **Solution**: Refresh the page (F5 or Ctrl+R)
